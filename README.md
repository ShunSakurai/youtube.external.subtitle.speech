# YouTube External Subtitle Speech

According to YouTube's [policy](http://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2734796?hl=en), only the owner of the content can add subtitle to a video.

With [YouTube External Subtitle](https://siloor.github.io/youtube.external.subtitle/) you can display subtitles over the embedded video from YouTube on your site. These texts could be translations, comments or lyrics as well. (Any kind of texts is allowed)

This fork adds text to speech functions to the [original repository](https://github.com/siloor/youtube.external.subtitle).
